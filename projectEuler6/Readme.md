# Project Euler Problem 6: Sum Square Difference

This repository contains a C++ program to solve [Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6) from Project Euler.

## Problem Description

The problem asks to find the difference between the sum of squares and the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

## Solution

The C++ program provided in this repository calculates the difference between the sum of squares and the square of the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100. It follows these steps:

1. Initialize variables to hold the sum of numbers and the sum of squared numbers.
2. Set the upper limit for the range of numbers to be considered.
3. Loop through numbers from 1 to the defined limit.
   - Accumulate the sum of numbers and the sum of squared numbers.
4. Calculate the square of the sum of numbers.
5. Calculate the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of squares.
6. Output the calculated difference to the console.

## Running the Code

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
5. Compile the code using your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ filename.cpp -o outputname`).
6. Run the compiled executable (e.g., `./outputname`).
